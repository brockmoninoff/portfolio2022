      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Take Note is a flashcard app designed specifically for music learners. It allows users to study and be quized on decks made by the user as well as decks already in the app’s library.</p>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>How can music students learn the theory, terminology, and music notes that will help them be successful at learning to play and enjoy a musical instrument?</p>
      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p>I followed a well-established design process including discovery, concepting, prototyping, and user testing.</p>
  </div> -->
  <div class="space">
      <h2>Discovery</h2>
      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <p>I downloaded a few flashcard apps and tested them out to get a feel for what was currently available in the app store and opportunities to add unique value to the space.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="list">
          <h4>Liked</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Buttons to flip whole deck while studying</li>
            <li>A library of pre-made decks</li>
            <li>Ability to quiz yourself</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="list">
          <h4>Didn't Like</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Small buttons that are too small</li>
            <li>Counterintuitive user flows</li>
            <li>High learning curve</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="list">
          <h4>Opportunity</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Create more streamlined and intuitive app navigation</li>
            <li>Include quiz history to see progress over time</li>
            <li>Create quiz for frequently missed cards</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I decided to target young adults trying to learn music for the first time. I wanted to provide a learning experience that was extremely convenient and didn’t feel juvenile. To help me empathize with the target user, I created a user persona and put myself in their shoes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="space">
    <h2>Concepting</h2>
    <h3>User Flows</h3>
    <p>I created user flows for primary tasks that would be completed in the app to help me understand what pages and navigation I would need to accomodate my app idea. </p>
    <img src="img/userflow.png" alt="">
    <h3>Wireframe 1</h3>
    <p>Started with the main pages and navigation without worried too much about other interactions.</p>
    <img src="img/wireframe1.png" alt="">
    <h3>Wireframe 2</h3>
    <p>Firmed up the main pages of the app and dove a little deeper on specifics of each page.</p>
    <img src="img/wireframe2.png" alt="">
    <h3>Wireframe 3</h3>
    <p>Highest fidelity wireframe with interstitial pages included and some copy.</p>
    <img src="img/wireframe3.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="space">
    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p>Finally, I created a prototype of the app in Figma so I could test the navigation, usability, and general pain points with potential users.</p>
    <img src="img/prototype.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="space">
    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <h3>Creating a Script</h3>
    <p>To prepare for user testing, I create a script to use. This helped me consistently set expectations, explain the purpose of the app, and outline the main tasks I wanted to observe the user doing.</p>
    <h3>Finding User Testers</h3>
    <p>I then reached out to friends and aquaintances, especially those with a music background who could give me speak to the usefulness of the app. Some of the user testers included a voice coach, a piano teacher, and a highschool band director. </p>
    <h3>"Taking Note"</h3>
    <p>During user testing sessions I tried not to prompt the tester other than to give them a task to complete and answer basic questions. I also asked them to speak out loud as much as possible while navigating the prototype. This helped me understand the user and the pain points they experienced much better than I could have just observing.</p>
    <img src="img/usertesting.gif" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="space">
    <h2>User Testing Results</h2>
    <h3>Accelerated Learning</h3>
    <p>User testing allowed me to quickly make improvements to the design and illiminate points of confusion that I wasn’t aware of. Some of the improvements testers helped identify were things like better button labels, rearranging elements for better flow, and adding more personality to spark joy in the user.</p>
    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <!-- <h3>A Younger Audience?</h3> -->
    <p>More than one user tester expressed interest in using the app to help their students learn music notes and vocabulary outside of their lessons. This caused me to rethink the audience I was taregeting. Younger music students may be a better market fit than adult independent learners. </p>
    <!-- <h3>Gamification</h3> -->
    <p>User testers repeatidly referenced Duolingo as a learning app that they enjoyed using. They suggested that turning the learning into more of a game would increase engagement and help fullfill the goal of helping users learn music.</p>
    <h3>User Sentiment</h3>
    <p>The consensus of the user testers was that they would find value in the app and were interested in seeing further iterations. One tester expressed,<span> “I’m very impressed! This is definitely an app that I would download and use to better my understanding of music.”<span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="space">
    <h2>UI and Brand Redesign</h2>
    <h3>Logo</h3>
    <p>I created a minimal and clear logo by abstracting the music note into an oval around “note”</p>
    <img src="img/logoevolution.png" alt="">
    <h3>Design System</h3>
    <p>In order to create reliable and consistent designs, I built a design system consisting of the basic components, type face, and colors used throught the app. This makes both designing and handing off to a developer a lot easier.</p>
    <img src="img/designsystem.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="space">
    <h2>Final Design</h2>
    <p>A selection of final reference frames</p>
    <img src="img/finalframes.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="space">
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <p>Through this spec project I came to understand and appreciate the design process. It became especially clear to me that user testing was the key to unlocking important insights. And that research done upfront is essential to producing a product that will add value</p>
    <h3>Confidence Boost</h3>
    <p>Designing an entire app from scratch seemed almost impossible, but by taking it one step at a time and getting plenty of feedback and support from others, I was able to not just finish, but feel proud of the work I accomplished.</p>
    <h3>Future Work</h3>
    <p>To continue work on this app I would do another round of user testing on the most recent prototype to check for any additional usability issues that may have been introduced during the UI update. After that I would doing additional research on how to best market the app and find a developer to bring the design to life. </p>
