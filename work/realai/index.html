    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>We were asked by our client to help reimagine their existing software from both a UX and UI standpoint. They asked for several options and recomendations for improvements. </p>
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>UX & UI Designer</p>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Discovery</li>
      <li>Ideation</li>
      <li>Exploration</li>
      <li>Prototyping</li>
      <li>Presentation</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="space" id="discovery">
    <h2>Discovery & Ideation</h2>
    <p>I preformed an audit of the existing app looking for opportunities to improve the UX and UI. I took notes and compared patterns I found in the app to patterns seen elsewhere in the wild and best practices.</p>
    <p>Before creating any frames in Figma, I spent time organizing my thoughts and drawing wireframes to help me solidify the concepts I wanted to develope further.</p>
    <img src="img/notes.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="space" id="prototype">
    <h2>LoFi Prototypes</h2>
    <p>To test design patterns and ideas before investing lots of time we created lofi prototypes to test with internal stakeholders.</p>
    <img src="img/lofi.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="space" id="cards">
    <h2>Cards</h2>
    <h3>Timeline Range Selector</h3>
    <p>These cards were designed to control map overlays that help the user visualize things like where and how fast land is developing and how it’s predicted to develope in the future. </p>
    <img src="img/range.png" alt="">
    <h3>Zoning Distribution Editor</h3>
    <p>This card was designed as a tool to help users make adjustments to the zoning distribution of a selection of parcels and see how those changes affect key indicators.</p>
    <img src="img/zoning.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="space" id="modals">
    <h2>Modals</h2>
    <h3>Settings</h3>
    <p>Complex tables were the backbone of the orginal app. We wanted to make these tables more accessible and customizable for the user. This settings modal was made to accomplish that goal.</p>
    <img src="img/setting.png" alt="">
    <h3>Glossary</h3>
    <p>While struggling to understand the existing app due to unfamiliar jargon, we came up with the idea of including a glossary of terms accessible from any page on the app.</p>
    <img src="img/glossary.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="space" id="pages">
    <h2>Pages</h2>
    <h3>Explore</h3>
    <p>One of the experiences that we wanted to optimize for was finding parcels of land. These pages show some of my explorative work.  </p>
    <img src="img/pages.png" alt="">
    <h3>Proforma</h3>
    <p>One of most difficult tasks I had was organizing all the data associated with a selection of parcels. These pages show explorations in dense data organization.</p>
    <img src="img/proforma.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="space" id="style">
    <h2>Styles</h2>
    <p>As a part of the exploration work we did, I created a list of suggested color and typography styles. The colors were carefully chosen to follow industry conventions for zone types and bring a more vibrant feel to the UI. </p>
