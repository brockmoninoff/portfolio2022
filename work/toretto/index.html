    <h1>Redesigning A Car Enthusiast Mobile App</h1>

    <p class="lede">Creating a unique UI and upgrading the UX of an existing consumer app</p>
  </div>
  <div class="space" id="intro">
    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>Our client came to us with an existing app that they wanted to update. Changes that fell within scope were a complete UI redesign and basic UX improvements that didn’t distrupt the underlying data structure.</p>
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>I worked as the lead designer along side one other experienced designer. I did the majority of the work and created most of the final deliverables and assets.</p>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>We started by taking an audit of the existing app. Then we did a competitive analysis, created a list of possible improvements to the app, did a branding/UI exploration, created prototypes, and finally, tested with a group of existing users. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="space" id="nav">
    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p>One big opportunities we saw for improvement was the main navigation of the app. The existing app had a confusion bottom nav bar that wasn’t consistant from page to page. Additionally, navigation to some of the main pages was hidden in menus or below the fold on the homepage.</p>
    <p>We streamlined the navigation by adding more buttons to the bottom nav bar and one addition button to the top nav. We also moved the back button from the bottom nav to the top left corner when it was needed. This follows current best practices for mobile app navigation.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="space" id="explore">
    <h2>UI Exploration</h2>
    <p>One of the clients main requests was a complete restyling of the app. We explored a few different options and got feedback from real users during a preference test. Elements from several of the exporations made it into the final design.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="space" id="onboarding">
    <h2>Onboarding</h2>
    <p>The existing onboarding experience only allowed selection of activities and brands you’re interested in. It was functional, but the interation design was a little cumbersome. Through an analysis of the interests data and some iteration on new design patterns, we created a new onboarding flow that steps the user through a series of easy questions and has the added functionality of letting the user connect with friends already on the app and immediately add cars to their garage. </p>
